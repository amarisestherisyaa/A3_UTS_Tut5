## Introduction
Music and lyric videos are mostly created in a static format, a one-way form where audiences just watch from their screens. With the introduction of 360 music video, there has been massive change, where users are able to immerse into the songwriter's world. In this project, I aim to further enhance audiences' experience in watching music or lyric videos. Through this project, audiences are able to interact with the elements within a music or lyric video. The interactive elements is hoped to pull audiences' towards the songwriter's message in real time. 

## Technologies
- Processing 4.0.1
- Sound 2.3.1
- controlP5 2.2.6

## Launch
- Download [audio file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Ux9n3UhRhtwykMJX2oFR6Fc9l8ut4FC/view?usp=sharing). Then change the path name in line 7 of the code according to where you store the file in your computer. 

## Project Status
